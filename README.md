# Qiskit-Fall-Fest-2024-Seattle
## Notebook 1
- Quantum Circuit Construction: Created and manipulated Bell states and applied quantum operators (XX, ZI, ZZ).
- Optimization: Focused on improving circuit performance using Qiskitâ€™s optimization tools

## Notebook 2
### Part I (Quantum States and Circuits)
- Bell and W-State Circuits: Creating and visualizing entangled states (Singlet Bell and W-state).
- Running with Sampler.run: Executing quantum circuits using Sampler.run.

### Part II: VQE and Qiskit 1.0:
- Parameterized Ansatz Circuit: Building a quantum circuit with tunable parameters for variational algorithms.
- QiskitRuntimeService and Sessions: Using QiskitRuntimeService for local and remote job execution, including sessions and testing mode.
## Notebook 3 (Couldn't complete)
- Lagged Behind in concepts of Notebook 3. Hence, its incomplete
